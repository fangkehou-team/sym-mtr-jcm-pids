# Introduction
This project is a subsidiary of the Shenyang Metro Resource Pack project, responsible for recreating all PIDS within the Shenyang Metro system using the MTR4 and JCM modules.

The currently recreated PIDS include:

- [Concourse Level Bidirectional Current Train](pids/concourse_level.md)
- [Concourse Level Destination Station](pids/concourse_level_destination.md)
- [Platform Level Current and Next Train (Post Line 4 Congestion Version)](pids/platform_level_after4.md)
- [Platform Level Current and Next Train (Pre Line 4 Welcome Version)](pids/platform_level_before4.md)
- [Platform Level Destination Station](pids/platform_level_destination.md)

Each type has two versions: sidebar on the left and sidebar on the right.

This project currently supports two configuration methods:

- [Configuration via configuration file (building an additional resource pack)](config/file.md)
- [Configuration via custom information](config/custom.md)

The two methods can be stacked, with custom information configuration items overriding file configuration items.
